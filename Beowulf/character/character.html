            <p>Beowulf, the warrior, fights for the good of all, and he is a brave battle-hardened leader who kills various ferocious beats.The warrior is a hero among heroes, and while he became a king, later on, he is celebrated for being a heroic warrior in battle. Beowulf represents a selfless warrior and hero intent on defeating evil and protecting the people while also being loyal to the king. In the mythological construction of heroism, the warriors are essential to the community’s thriving. There is a hierarchical relationship between the king and the subjects, but the brave-battle warriors ensure that the king rules in peace. Beowulf fought the monsters alone when he believed it was best to go it alone, even when he did not need weapons. Beowulf knew his powers had declined as a king, but he remained a brave protector who was well respected by the subjects. </p>
