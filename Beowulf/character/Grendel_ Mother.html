            <h1>Grendel’s Mother</h1>
            <img id="grendel_mother" src="../images/grendel's%20mother.jpg">
            <p>Grendel's mother, like her son, is a mysterious humanoid. She enters the poem as an avenger, seeking compensation for her son's death at the hands of Beowulf. For this reason, some readers see Grendel's mother as a manifestation of the never-ending blood feud tendencies of ancient Northern European societies. Other readers think she represents the suffering of women in the blood feud system. Before Grendel's mother attacked, we heard the story of Hildeburh, a princess who lost all her male relatives because her brother's family fell out with her husband. Grendel's mother, however, was much more than the embodiment of blood feuding and its failings. She lived in a "pure" place whose bottom "has never been explored by the sons of man". Many readers see it as a powerful symbol of the mysteries beyond the human subconscious or human knowledge. To these readers, Grendel's mother came to represent the dangers faced by anyone trying to confront the unknown, whether in the world or in themselves. </p>
