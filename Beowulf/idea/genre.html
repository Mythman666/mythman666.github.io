            <p>	Epic heroic writing, a long poem, which written by ancient English. </p>
                
            <p>This poem focus on mythical heroism links the heroes and warriors to a strong society, and they are praised for their glorious deeds that make society better off. The poet writes, “In the place of his pyre, mighty and glorious, since he was of men the most worthy warrior throughout the wide world, while he could enjoy the wealth” (3097-3099). The passage emphasizes the place of warriors and heroes in society, and they are described with the words’ might,’ “glorious,” and “worthy.” Warriors and heroes did not have to prove themselves to the people as they already knew they fought and won on behalf of the people. Beowulf also can be seen as an elegy because heroic values are disappeared nowadays. This long poem mourns those heroes and their deeds and values. </p>
