            <h1>Style</h1>
            <p>Beowulf's style is blunt and creative. The language of the poem is rich in body language, with a special emphasis on the body and its vulnerability: "The flames wreak havoc in the house of hot bones". Here, "bone-house," which means "body," is an example of a kenning. A kenning is a special kind of metaphor in which two nouns are combined to form a new word and used in place of another noun. Another example is the "Whale Road" of the Sea. Kenning is a characteristic of Beowulf. They help to create the solid feel of the poem by describing things in strong imagistic terms. The image of the whale moving through the water, or the bone lifting the meat, is more direct than the image evoked by "sea" or "body." Another notable feature of the style is its poetic form, known as alliteration. Each line of the poem is divided into two halves, and each half contains two stressed syllables. The halves are linked by the fact that one or two stressed syllables in the first half of the line alliterate with the first stressed syllable in the second half of the line. The balance of each line, as well as the intricate sound patterns, make the poem feel solid. </p>
